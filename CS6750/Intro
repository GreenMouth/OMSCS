Happy Monday & Good Morning,

I am Prashant Shinde, currently living in Atlanta. 
This is my second OMSCS semester. Before HCI, I have completed only 1 course (CS 6460: Ed Tech from D. Joyner).

Why are you taking CS6750: Human-Computer Interaction:
In my company, we have a dedicated UI & UX (User Interface & User Experience) team to build beautiful & interactive User Interface for our data driven Machine Learning products.
The team's work is really an art and involves a lot of work like drawings, requirement gathering & feedback collection through focus groups, etc.
I am really curious to understand science, art & technology behind this.

Besides, OMSCS, I work full time in a Marketing domain & I like recording/editing YouTube videos.
