CS 6460: 'Educational' Technology (EdTech)

If you think no one has done your idea before, then you haven’t looked hard enough.
Nearly every idea has been explored; the question is always: what are you going to do better, or different?

Goal: 
Reserach & contribute to Educational Technology community
(simply, learn aboout use of technology in education)

Open ended, research focused (a lot of reading, A LOT!) course

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology

Example: Use of technology 
1. in learning 
2. in admission process
3. in course registration process, etc.

Outcome: Paper publication on Ed Tech

No videos material available for this class but has a curated library of:
1. Reserach publications
2. Media articles
3. Original Interviews

** Pick a topic which interest you and do projects 

2 project tracks (or Hybrid):
Track 1: 'Designs' that solve problems (Piazza, Slack, OSCAR, etc.)
Track 2: 'Research' that investigate phenomenon (how certain tools actually change the learning process)

Week 1:
I think I will pick 'Reserach' track (which may include reading paper, collect data, do analysis & conclusion)
Topic: around UCG (user content generation) like Youtube, etc.

General class Info:
Piazza is the classroom for this class
Udacity is the textbook and 
Canvas is the box at the front of the room where you drop your homework

This class is highly experimental
course structure that is highly student-driven
You'll spend the first third of the class exploring the field, settling on an idea to pursue, and proposing an interesting project.

Piazza participation: 
1. participation as a formal part of your performance in the class
2. participation is never about volume; it's solely about quality

Assignments due every Monday morning in the United States (8 am deadline).
This course is an open-world game, while most OMSCS classes are more linear.
form and pursue your own research direction.

simply put, a paper is: to make a claim and justify

2. Read the introduction
3. Read the conclusion
4. Read other relevent sections

The biggest mistake people make in this class is to assume that their ideas are totally new, 
and therefore they do not need to look at what others have done. This is never true. 
Even if your idea is very different from others, there are analogues to others’ work from which you can likely learn. 
And even if your idea somehow is totally new, you need to be able to explain what makes it new, 
which requires understanding what others have done.
