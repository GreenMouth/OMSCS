A PhD is marked by four major milestones:

Matriculation is the start of the program. For us, that's the start of the semester. On campus, the first year is marked by participating in different labs, exploring different research, and deciding what you want to do. Our two or three weeks are a miniature version of that.

Qualifying occurs about two years into the program. Here, you take a big hard test that proves you understand the field you're interesting. For us, that was the Personal Question.

Proposing occurs about three to four years into the program. Here, you propose your dissertation. Your proposal is a contract between you and your thesis committee: if you do what you said you'll do in your proposal, you get to graduate. That's where we are now with the project proposal.

Defending occurs about five to six years into the program. Here, you show that you did what you proposed to do. If you can do so, you graduate!
